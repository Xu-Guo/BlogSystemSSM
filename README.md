### Why use SSM?
SpringMVC:
Powerful web MVC framework, more flexible then struts, with springMVC, requests are easily dispatched to controllers and handled by calling functions and with ModelAndView object data models and views are easily returned to front end. Aop is also supported by SpringMVC.

Spring:
Power application framework implements inversion of control container and aop for the Java platform. Spring helps store and manage Java beans and transfers the control from programmer to the framework itself. With aop, those application which handles large amount of object are also easily handled by the framework.

MyBatis:
At the same layer with Hibernate, the difference between then is that Mybatis matches customized requirements more than Hibernate. Customized SQL and help increase the efficiency of accessing database.Manage SQL with xml, easy for debug and optimize.
